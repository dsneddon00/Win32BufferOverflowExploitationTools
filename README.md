# Win32BufferOverflowExploitationTools
This repo contains various python scripts I wrote while exploiting 32 bit Windows systems using stack based buffer overflow techniques.

- bad_chars.py is used to help identify which characters crash a program.
- eip_controller.py is used to gain control of the eip register
- wavPayloadGenerator.py generates a basic .wav payload made to break a program that takes in .wav inputs. Like the other programs in this repo, can be modified to mimic other file types.
- win_exploit.py generates a .wav exploit that launches the calculator app. Used to test for working shellcode.
- win_exploit_reverse_shell.py generates a reverse shell that will send signals at the LHOST IP address and the LPORT. Use in conjunction with the "nc -lvnp 1234" on another computer to gain access to the backdoor.
