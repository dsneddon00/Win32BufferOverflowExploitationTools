# Win32BufferOverflowExploitationTools
This repo contains various python scripts I wrote while exploiting 32 bit Windows systems using stack based buffer overflow techniques.

- bad_chars.py is used to help identify which characters crash a program.
- eip_controller.py is used to gain control of the eip register
- wavPayloadGenerator.py generates a basic .wav payload made to break a program that takes in .wav inputs. Like the other programs in this repo, can be modified to mimic other file types.
- win_exploit.py generates a .wav exploit that launches the calculator app. Used to test for working shellcode.
- win_exploit_reverse_shell.py generates a reverse shell that will send signals at the LHOST IP address and the LPORT. Use in conjunction with the "nc -lvnp 1234" on another computer to gain access to the backdoor.
- win32bof_exploit_remote.py is a full suite of remote buffer overflow exploitation code to use on a target that includes a reverse shell exploit and a menu for each of your commands.

## Win32bof_exploit_remote Usage
```
python3 win32bof_exploit_remote.py 
[f]uzz
[e]ip offset
[b]ad_chars
e[i]p control
e[x]ploit
Enter command to execute: 
```

Simply enter a command (based on bracketed character) to accomplish the task needed. If network connectivity to the target is required, edit the 'IP' and 'port' variables inside the win32bof_exploit_remote.py script.
